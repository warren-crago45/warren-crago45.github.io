    Ever since I was a young, I have always been fascinated with computers and what they are able to do.  With this fascination, came the want to know how a computer operates and how to be able to tell a computer what to do.  I started tinkering with computers and even taking some apart that were broken, just to see what was inside of them and what made them work.  Once I had a vague idea of how the hardware of the computer worked, I wanted to know how the software side of the computer worked, so I enrolled in almost all of the computer tech courses that my highschool had and would allow me to take.  It's where I learned some of the basic coding building blocks and became familiar with basic JavaScript and HTML.  Unfortunately, my highschool did not have that many classes to really expand my knowledge on the subject, so I had to teach myself through whatever means I could find until I started college.
		
		I ended up attending college at the University of South Carolina, going for a Computer Science degree.  It was around this time that I really started to get a grasp of the fundamentals of coding and the core mechanics of hardware.  Although, at times it made me feel like I had no idea how much of the components worked or acted together.  I unfortunately ran out of scholarships and grants by about the end of my Junior year of college and not wanting to take on a mountain of student loan debt, I decided to join the Navy.  I joined the Navy in 2016 and had the job of being a CTM (Cryptologic Technician Maintenance), which is the fixing and maintaining of confidentail communication equipment and other confidential equipment.  I served in the Navy for four years and then decided to get out and continue college with the G.I. Bill that I received.
		
		However, I received a job offer to work as a government contractor with a company called CACI right before I seperated from the Navy.  It is currently where I am working and I love my job and the company, but I would like to get back to what I had originally intended to be.  So I am wanting to learn Software Engineering so I can switch over to a coding position within the company and possibly open up doors to opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise.  So I'm looking forward to re-igniting things I haven't used in a long time and learning new things that I didn't learn in college or while in the military.
